# ZMK config for pillzmod-pro

This is a zmk config repository for the awesome [pillzmod pro](https://github.com/dcpedit/pillzmod) by @dcpedit.
It uses a [separate zmk-module for the pillzmod-pro shield](https://github.com/voelzmo/zmk-module-pillzmod-pro) for easy referencing.

This setup makes it very convenient to modify your keymap or configuration (e.g. zmk studio enablement) and re-build your firmware. It also makes it more easy to consume upstream modifications of zmk, so you get to enjoy all the nice bugfixes.
